# Career Services Application
## 1. Project Description

This repository has been created to facilitate the management of a career service application where students can search for jobs, update their portfolios, and post their qualifications for potential employers to view. The platform allows employers to shortlist suitable candidates, while students can identify their desired job opportunities. Users can create their profiles using their email addresses and passwords, ensuring the security of their login credentials.

Additionally, the system incorporates robust security measures to safeguard sensitive information. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and maintain the confidentiality of user data. Moreover, employers will receive notifications when students apply for their job offers, and students will be alerted when they are called for interviews.
